I am an experienced software developer and leader from Munich.
As a backend developer I'm passionat about developing systems that solve complex problems and deliver real value to customers.

With my experience as a Product Owner, Scrum Master, Data Scientist and Team Lead, I deeply understand software development aspects beyond pure technology.

My true passion is for people! Effective communication, autonomy and a holistic systemic-constructivist view are essential for building successful software solutions.

A strong team with an aspiration for self-improvement is a prerequisite for success. I want to keep learning and growing personally and professionally, and I want to help my team and company do the same. 

With my experience in software development and focus on customer needs, I am always looking for ways to innovate and improve. 

If you are looking for an experienced software developer and a leader for whom people are more important than technologies and want to add real value to their customers, then we should talk!
